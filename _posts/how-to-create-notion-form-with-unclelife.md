## Step 4: Designing Your Form

## Step 5: Mapping Fields to Notion Columns (Optional When you create form with database)
Once your form is ready, it's time to map the form fields to the corresponding columns in your Notion database.
1. In UncleLife.co, navigate to the 'Map Fields' section.
2. Match each form field with the appropriate Notion column.
